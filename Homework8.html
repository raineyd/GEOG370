    <h1>Homework 8: Map of South Carolina Counties</h1>
    <h2>Rainey Dunham 730336342</h2>
    <h2>The ratio I chose to make shows the population of each South Carolina county living under the poverty level in comparison to the total population of that county. It is important to consider the number of people living in poverty in reference to the number of total people in a region because where there is more people there will be more poverty. If the data was not a ratio it may lead to more populated counties seeming poorer than they really are. I chose this data set becasue I thought it might be interesting to see if how poverty was distributed in the state and if certain geographical areas much poorer than others. </h2>
   
    <h3>This map shows the ratio categorized by natural breaks.</h3>
    <h4> This way of organizing data is best for unevenly distributed data but a disadvantage is that this method can create groups with very different ranges which can be seen to a small degree in my map as one catagory has a range of five and others have a range of ten. </h4>

        <h3>This map shows the ratio categorized by equal interval.</h3>
        <h4> Equal interval catigorization is best for for continuous data sets and forms an easily readable legend. Although, this way of organizing data can lead to data falling mostly into a few catagories. This disadvantage did not seem to affect my map as the distrobution of data to different groups is identical to the natural breaks map above.</h4>

            <h3>This map shows the ratio categorized by equal count or quantile organization.</h3>
            <h4>This method of organizing data is best for data that is evenly distributed. A disadvantage of this method is that data placed in the same group can have significantly different values which is visibly exemplified in my map as many more counties are placed in the highest group than in the other two maps. </h4>
